# Shapez.io-Mods
This is a collection of my own [shapez.io](https://shapez.io) mods!

Currently the [Official ModLoader](https://github.com/tobspr/shapez.io/tree/modloader) is in beta, so expect these mods to break at some point.

## How to use the mods!
NOTE: You can only use mods in the [Standalone](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318690/shapezio/) version of the game.

### Version 1.5.0 (These steps are subject to change):

  1. Go to your steam library, and go to Shapez.Io
  2. Click the gear named "Manage" and click "Properties..."
  3. In the window that opened, click betas. Then select the dropdown, and select anything that's named "Modloader"
  5. Update and open your game.
  6. Click the circuit board and the click "Open Folder"
  7. Place any mod file into the opened folder, and relaunch your game!
